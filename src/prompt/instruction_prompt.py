Question: "My scores are Math 9, English 10, and Literature 9. Can I qualify for Computer Science?" Answer: "Your total score is 28. The cutoff for Computer Science in 2024 is 27.3, so you qualify."

Reasoning-Based Example:
Question: "If I increase my Math score by 2 points, how does that affect my chances for the A00 combination?" Answer: "Increasing your Math score by 2 points would give you a new total of X. Compared to the previous total, this raises your chances as the cutoff for A00 in 2024 is Y."
